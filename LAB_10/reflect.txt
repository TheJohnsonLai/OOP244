// Reflection, workshop 10, Johnson Lai

1. I  didn't attempt to place my functions in the .cpp file. Yes, it worked when the entire function was in the 
header file. All of my functions were inside the header file.

2. Yes, the template works when defined in the main .cpp file, before the main() function. However, it has to be 
defined before main(), as otherwise the function wouldn't be defined when main() runs. Unless you define a prototype(?).

3. 0, as integers do not store decimals.

4. I believe so. The advantage of templates include simplicity, reducing code redundancy, and making it easier to code
for multiple outputs. Mostly preventing redundancy.

5. Yes. At least, in my code, I could call the functions with those 2 versions and no difference would be noticed.
