1. The memory used for the dynamic object is held, wasting physical bits. Exiting without deallocating 
the memory will cause a memory leak.
2. Static memory is assigned and destroyed within its scope, while dynamic memory can change size and
is not freed unless forced to. As an example, I used dynamic memory for an array to hold a specific size
of Kingdoms, while I used a static array to hold statistics of a set number of expected values.
3. This workshop I learned about deallocating dynamic arrays, calling arrays in functions, and setting
class objects to public / private.
