1. A Safe empty state is the initial data held by an object such that it will not corrupt memory, 
spew gibberish when used, or never end. It is essentially a safe initilization. For passenger, I 
could set the strings as "Bob" and the date to January 1, 1990. Those are safe states as they represent
their type correctly and do not overflow.

2. A case where multiple Passenger constructors would be useful could be when clients receive multiple
passengers and their information varies, from having all data available (names, date, destination) to
passengers that are yet to have a confirmed flight (only name and destination) to a passenger of no 
destination (refugee). In these cases, having to simply call the object with any data constructor would
minimalize the worry over having all of the information to create information about the passenger.

3. This workshop I learned how to call constructors and overload them. I also learned to use string 
functions such as strcpy and strcmp, as long as disabling part of the source program to use strcpy. 
Additionally I learned about strings and "empty" states, which are terminating characters '\0', which 
helps me understand computer language a little bit more.
